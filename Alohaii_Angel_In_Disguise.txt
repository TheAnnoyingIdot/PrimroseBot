I wish I told you all this long ago, but now it's too much for my pride
But if I never had a chance to grow, then how will you make up your mind
Cause she has never really loved you from the start
But you could never even spend a day apart, it breaks my heart
Cause I'm an angel but in disguise, I see your face when I close my eyes
I feel your gaze on mine, and to my surprise, I'm already out of time
I know you see right through my facade, I never came here to cause you harm
Just wanna take you on, cause what could go wrong? So tell me whose side you're on
I'm calling, just to say I've fallen for you
Can we cut the stalling? Can we get to talking? It's true
And I can't waste another second I spend with you
Can we cut the stalling? Baby, now I'm falling and the cracks are slipping through
Cause I'm an angel but in disguise, I see your face when I close my eyes
I feel your gaze on mine, and to my surprise, I'm already out of time
I know you see right through my facade, I never came here to cause you harm
Just wanna take you on, cause what could go wrong? So tell me whose side you're on
Oh, but what if she could love you more than I, though I try
I'll take you to the sea, and maybe then you'll see me eye to eye
I know that I am nothing in comparison, because she has a halo brighter than the sun
I wish that I could just turn into anyone, apart from me, apart from me
Cause I'm an angel but in disguise, I see your face count it every time
I feel your gaze on mine, and to my surprise, I'm already out of time
I know you see right through my facade, I never came here to cause you harm
Just wanna take you on, cause what could go wrong? So tell me whose side you're on
